          accommodations). Sensitive personal information you voluntarily submit
          is processed on the basis of your consent, which you may revoke at any

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Personal Information Generated By Us. As you use our Services, we
          generate certain personal information about you, including through
          automatic data collection and by inferences based on the information
          we collect about you and your activity. We may automatically collect
          information about your interactions with the Services or
          communications you receive (such as email) using certain technologies,
          such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our Cookies
          and Interest-Based Advertising Policy for more details). We generate
          the following categories of personal information about you:
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Device information. When you visit or use our Services, we
          automatically collect certain information about your device (e.g.,
          your mobile device, computer, or tablet), including information about
          your hardware and software, device configuration, and nearby networks.
          Such data may include data about your device operating systems,
          browsers, and other software installed on your device; such as IP
          address or other device identifier; country of origin, region and
          language settings; and information about domain servers and wireless
          or network access points near your device.
        </p>

        <p>
          Usage and performance information. We also automatically collect
          personal information about your usage of the Services, including
          information about your searches, statistics about the travel
          itineraries you share with us, how you interact with the features of
          our Services and the links you click, your preferences, access times,
          referring URL, and performance of our Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Location information. If you use our Services, we automatically
          collect approximate location information about you (such as your city)
          or, with your consent, precise geographic location data from your
          mobile device when the app is running and when it is not running,
          depending on the choices you make when you are asked to consent to our
          collection of location information. The technologies we use to
          determine your location may include IP address mapping, cell tower
          position, Wi-Fi position and GPS signals. We may use and store this
          information to provide and improve features of our Services, for
          example, to tailor our Services on a needs-based manner to better
          facilitate your requests (such as helping you find the hotel closest
          to you) and to provide you with more relevant content in the cities
          you visit (such as sending you marketing communications relating to
          goods or services in your current city, including local accommodations
          and travel options). Sun Holidays  does not have control over your
          device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on
          your device so you can take advantage of the location-based features
          and functionality offered. Please see the Your Rights and Choices
          section below for more information about how to adjust your
          preferences, including those related to location information.

          automatically or manually for relevant travel details and imported
          into our Trips service (along with a copy of the email, which is saved
          to your Trips account). See the Trips Services section below for more

          you according to your preferences or restrictions. For example, if you
          frequently book rooms at four-star hotels and rent cars when you

          bring you a combined package offer for hotel and car, or prioritize
          accommodations you have previously booked

          partners and advertising partners to display advertisements for
          four-star Tokyo hotels to you on other websites you visit.

          If you register for an account, send a booking confirmation to our
          Trips service or make a booking through our Services, you will have
          access to our Trips service, where we will collect your travel
          information to create and maintain your travel itineraries. If you
          directly send us booking confirmation emails, you authorize us to
          parse these emails automatically or manually and to add the
          information you provide to your Trips account, along with other
          information that we have collected (including saving a copy of the
          original email to your Trips account). If you sign up for the
          synchronization of your emails to our Trips service, you authorize us
          to access the emails in the email accounts you have connected to
          Trips, to regularly review these emails in order to identify those
          that are booking confirmations that we can import into our Trips
          service, to parse these emails automatically or manually and to add
          the information we have collected to your Trips account (including
          saving a copy of the original email to your Trips account). To the
          extent permissible by our email synchronization partners, we use the
          information in your Trips account to show you more relevant search
          results (e.g., accommodations you previously booked) or to provide you
          statistics about your travels, and we may use such information for
          marketing communications as described above. If you use or have
          itineraries as part of our Trips Service, you can send or grant access
          to your itinerary to anyone you choose. Your itinerary may contain
          enough details (e.g., booking reference codes) to allow the recipient
          to cancel or modify your booking, perform a check-in, etc. You should
          only share your itinerary with people you trust. Please also refer to
          our Getting Started with Trips page and the detailed Trips FAQ for
          answers to frequently asked questions, and visit your Account page to
          update your account settings and preferences. If you choose to display
          your itinerary on publicly-viewable web pages (Facebook, for
          instance), that information may be collected and used by others.

          phone number that you provide to us by way of direct dial calls,
          autodialled and pre-recorded message calls, and text messages in
          connection with the above Purposes.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Our Role as Data Controller. For purposes of European Union law and
          similar data protection regimes, we generally act as a data
          controller, meaning we determine the purposes and means of processing
          your personal information. Our travel partners to whom we may connect
          you to make reservations are also data controllers. To learn more
          about how a travel partner may use your personal information, you
          should review its privacy notice.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Processing Bases and Consequences. When we process your personal
          information, we rely on the following legal bases:
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Performance of the contract we have with you (for example, if you use
          our Services to book a flight, we will process your information in
          order to allow the relevant airline partner to complete and administer
          that booking).
        </p>

        <p>
          Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject (such as
          when we are obliged to comply with lawful requests from competent
          authorities such as law enforcement).
        </p>

        <p>
          To serve our legitimate interests (such as tailoring your experience
          with our Services, carrying out online advertising, and for fraud
          detection), provided that such processing does not outweigh your
          rights and freedoms. The processing must also be pursuant to other
          applicable legal bases for data processing, especially provisions set
          out under local law.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we use personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we
          take steps to ensure that your rights to your personal information are
          not infringed. You can contact us using the details set out in the How
          to Contact Us section below for more information about the steps we
          take to ensure these rights are not infringed. You also have the right
          to object to such processing as described in the Your Choices and
          Rights section below.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Consent. To the extent that a legal ground described above would not
          apply to processing of your personal information by us, we will seek
          your consent for such specific purpose in accordance with applicable
          law (such as sending direct marketing messages by electronic means,
          like email, without an exception from the requirement to obtain
          consent).
        </p>

        <p>
          Aggregate Information. We aggregate personal information collected
          directly from you, information generated about you by us, and
          information obtained from third parties (with your consent, where
          required) with personal information collected about other users in
          order to produce general statistics that cannot be linked to you or
          any other specific user. Information that has been aggregated and
          de-identified is no longer considered &ldquo;Personal
          information&rdquo; and may be subsequently used for any purpose.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Anonymized Information. We may process information that cannot be
          linked to you or any other specific user using any means available to
          us, either because it was collected anonymously or has been
          subsequently anonymized. Information that is anonymous or has been
          anonymized is no longer considered &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo;
          and may be subsequently used for any purpose.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          When you make a request, we also share with the travel partner
          additional information about you, such as information about your
          travel activity and history, and/or information that we collect from
          you and third parties. Travel partners use this information for their
          own purposes, which may include to improve their products or services
          and to provide you with targeted advertising and marketing
          communications, where permitted under law.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Sharing with Our Group Companies. We share your information with our
          affiliates and subsidiaries in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as with

          subsidiaries (collectively, as also defined earlier in this Privacy
          Policy, our &ldquo;group companies&rdquo;). We may share your
          information with our group companies for the following reasons:
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Provide you with integrated services (including to administer and
          manage reservations, bookings, services, and payments across our
          affiliated platforms).
        </p>

        <p>
          Provide personalized offers or send you marketing communications with
          your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Enable &ldquo;single sign-on&rdquo;, i.e., allowing you to log into a
          shared account for multiple Booking Holdings Inc. brands using a
          single set of log-in credentials, which allows us to, for example,
          show your reservations and bookings made through the websites,
          applications, and services of our group companies on your account
          page, and allow our group companies to show information in your
          respective account(s) with them.
        </p>

        <p>Provide customer support services.</p>

        <p>
          Detect, prevent, and investigate fraud and misuse of our services,
          other illegal activities, and data breaches.
        </p>

        <p>
          Analyze how users use our independent and affiliated platforms,
          including so that we may improve existing products and services and
          develop new features, products, and services that may be of interest
          to our users.
        </p>

        <p>Ensure compliance with applicable law.</p>

        <p>
          To learn more about your choices related to how we share your
          information with our group companies (including our subsidiaries, our
          parent company, and its other subsidiaries), please see the Your
          Choices and Rights section below.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Sharing with Our Business Partners. We share your information with
          other third-party business partners for their own marketing purposes.
          These third parties include online advertisers or ad tech companies,
          who may provide you with targeted advertising and marketing
          communications, where permitted under law. The information we share
          includes information collected through your use of our Services (e.g.,
          information about your bookings and reservations for flights, hotels,
          car rentals, or other travel accommodations) and information we
          collect about you through the use of cookies and similar technologies
          (e.g., information about the websites you visit; information about
          your searches, including the cities or destinations you search for,
          the types of accommodations you search for, your travel preferences,
          price range, intended travel dates, and the number of travelers in
          your party).
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          For example, if you frequently search for flights from Seattle to
          Paris around certain holidays, we may share that information with a
          particular airline partner so it can better understand which of our
          customers are interested in flights from Seattle to Paris on certain
          dates. The airline partner may then, for example, use this information
          to offer you a promotion.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          To learn more about your choices related to how we share your
          information with our business partners, please see the Your Choices
          and Rights section below.

          Sharing with Social Networking Services. Our Services allow you to
          connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information
          publicly or with friends. Our Services may also allow you to connect
          with us on, share on, and use third-party platforms, including those
          on which Sun Holidays  has a presence. Please be mindful of your
          personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose
          whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot
          control the privacy or security of information you choose to make
          public or share with others. Sun Holidays  also does not control the
          privacy practices of third-party platforms. Please contact those sites
          and services directly to learn about their privacy practices.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          Sharing to Process Payment Information. To use certain Services (such
          as to book a flight) and to make payments to certain of our travel
          partners, we require payment information (e.g., credit or debit card
          account information, other online payment method information, etc.).
          When you submit your payment information through our Services, we will
          share that information with travel partners, third-party payment
          processors, and other third-party service providers (including, but
          not limited to, vendors who provide fraud detection services to us and
          other third parties), to the extent necessary to meet our contractual
          obligations to you (e.g., to secure your reservation or make a payment
          to a travel partner where required), to meet our legitimate interests
          in preventing fraud and other misuses of our platforms or Services, or
          with your consent where this is required by law. In particular:
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          When you use a credit or debit card to secure a booking or reservation
          through our Services, we provide your credit or debit card account
          information (including card number and expiration date, and if
          required by the travel partner, CVV number) to the applicable travel
          partner to process the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you provide your credit or debit card account information through
          our Services, you will have the option to save your information to
          your account for future use. If you choose not to save your credit or
          debit card account information to your account, we will delete your
          credit or debit card account information after the transaction is
          complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          For information about the security of your payment information, see
          the How We Store and Protect Your Information section below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sharing with Other Service Providers. We share information with
          third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who
          perform services or functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or
          operating our Services, data collection, manually parsing booking
          confirmations, reporting, ad response measurement, site analytics,
          data analysis, delivering marketing messages and advertisements,
          processing credit card payments, and providing fraud detection
          services). We do not authorize these third parties to use or disclose
          your information for purposes other than those for which it has been
          provided. We require these third parties to maintain and implement
          security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access
          or processing.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</p>

        <p>
          Sun Holidays  maintains commercially-reasonable technical,
          administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect
          your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration, and destruction.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          When your payment information is being transmitted to our Services or
          through our Services, it will be protected by cryptographic protocols.
          To be clear, Sun Holidays  only stores your payment information if
          you choose to save that information to your account. When you submit a
          booking or reservation, we transfer your payment information to the
          applicable travel partner to process the transaction. Our contracts
          with third parties that receive your payment information require them
          to keep it secure and confidential.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          However, we cannot guarantee that transmissions of your payment
          information or your other information will always be secure or that
          unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security
          measures taken by Sun Holidays  or our third-party service providers.
          Except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded or limited due
          to applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for
          disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission,
          unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.
          You play an important role in keeping your information secure. You
          should not share your user name, password, or other security
          information for your Sun Holidays  account with anyone. If we receive
          instructions using your user name and password, we will assume you
          have authorized the instructions. If you have reason to believe that
          your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that
          the security of any account you might have with us has been
          compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed in the How to
          Contact Us section below.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Retention. We may retain your personal information for as long as your
          account is active and for a period of time thereafter to allow you to
          re-activate your account without loss of information. We may also
          retain your personal information as necessary to:
        </p>

        <p>
          Maintain logs and business records for analysis, security, and/or
          audit purposes
