            When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we request

            (placing a temporary &quot;hold&quot; on the funds). If for some

            There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may not have

            on the credit card. In such instances where the fare may have

            the right to cancel the booking at no cost to you. When the booking

        We act as an agent only. We sell various travel related products as agent on behalf of numerous transport, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, hotel, rail ticket, Bus Ticket and cruise line operators, and as agent for all of our wholesalers. Our obligation to you is to (and you expressly authorise us to) make travel bookings as agent on your behalf and to arrange relevant contracts between you and travel service providers. We have no responsibility for these services nor do we make or give any warranty or representation regarding their standard. All bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions and limitations of liability imposed by these service providers. We can provide you with copies of the relevant service provider terms and conditions on request. Your legal recourse for travel services is against the specific provider and, except to the extent a problem is caused by fault on our part, not against us. Specifically, if for any reason (excluding fault on our part), any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which you have contracted, your remedy lies against the provider and not with us.

Our liability will also be limited to the extent that any relevant international conventions limit the amount of compensation which can be claimed for death, injury, or delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage. Under circumstances where our liability cannot be excluded and where liability may be lawfully limited, such liability is limited to the remedies required of us under applicable consumer laws.
